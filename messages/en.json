Our algorithms have been validated by a team of specialized accountants, allowing automatic calculation and generation of all information necessary for IRS declarations."
      },
      "howDoesItHelp": {
        "question": "How does IRSimples help investors?",
        "answer1": "Submitting IRS reports is a complex and bureaucratic process that requires detailed knowledge of annexes and access to all purchase and sale information from brokers. Additionally, capital gains reports provided by brokers â€” especially foreign ones â€” do not always follow the tax rules applicable in Portugal (FIFO).",
        "answer2": "For the calculation to be correct, it is necessary to gather the complete history of all transactions and calculate, from the beginning, gains and losses. However, annual broker reports rarely include details of purchase and sale dates, which can lead to loss of tax benefits, since the number of years you hold a stock directly influences the taxes to pay.",
        "answer3": "IRSimples aims to simplify and automate this entire process through direct import of purchase and sale transactions from brokers. The platform automatically performs all capital gains calculations, ensuring accuracy, time savings, and compliance with Portuguese law."

      "whyNotBrokerReports": {
        "question": "Why do I need IRSimples and annual broker reports are not enough?",
        "answer1": "Most annual broker reports only present the aggregated net result (P/L) or, at most, the P/L per stock, without details of each purchase and sale transaction. This causes loss of information about which sold stocks were already held for more than 2 years â€” which can bring tax advantages:",
        "taxRate2to5": "Stocks held between 2 and 5 years: 25.2%",
        "taxRate5to8": "Stocks held between 5 and 8 years: 22.4%",
        "taxRateOver8": "Stocks held for more than 8 years: 19.6%"
      },
      "whyUseBeforeYearEnd": {
        "question": "Why should I use IRSimples before the end of the year?",
        "answer": "Take advantage of easily calculating your P/L at the end of the year to evaluate the possibility of selling open positions at a loss and thus reduce taxable gains. Even if you want to keep the stock, nothing prevents you from selling at a loss and buying back immediately after. You will pay transaction commissions, but this strategy can help you reduce taxes if you have other profitable sales in the same fiscal year."

      "supportedBrokers": {
        "question": "Which brokers are supported?",
        "answer": "Currently, IRSimples supports two international brokers: DEGIRO and T212. Additionally, you can manually add transactions through an Excel template. We are working to soon integrate more brokers into the platform."

      },
      "supportedAnnexes": {
        "question": "Which IRS annexes are supported and automatically generated?",

      },
      "onlyCurrentYear": {
        "question": "Can I submit only the transactions from the fiscal year under analysis?",
        "answer": "No. You must submit the entire history since the account opening, because sales may be linked to purchases from previous years."
      },
      "portugueseDividends": {
        "question": "Why don't dividends from Portuguese companies appear in the report generated by IRSimples?",
        "answer": "Dividends from Portuguese companies are subject to a 28% withholding tax at source, already applied by the financial intermediary, which functions as a definitive liberating tax. Therefore, it is not necessary to declare them in the IRS, except if you opt for the aggregation of these incomes."
